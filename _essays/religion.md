Mythology, to me, is a collection of transcendental stories, music, characteristics, all serving as a latent space for humans to build the dream of a flawless entity. The entity is a projection surface. 

The non-transactional relationship to this entity is sprituality. It becomes the imagined agent to whom people can outsource their doubts, fears, need for cohesion, and agency.

Religion, then, is just a mental model built using mythology — a way of modeling our place in the world and our relationships within it. It is build with the frameworks described by the mythical entity.

We can use Shiva as an example: he doesn't offer any explicit moral or ethical frameworks to form a mental model. Hence the non-transactional relationship with him is purely magic of mythology. And that shows how mythology can channel spirituality without necessarily creating a religion.

We see people drawn to spirituality when they are looking for purpose, like need for cohesion or agency in their lives. In such moments, the mythical entity stands ready, offering a relationship where these needs can be outsourced. The path to this relationship is mythology, but the trap is the mythical entity’s religion. 

This is why we need to play safe with God.
