Mythology, to me, is a collection of transcendental stories, music, characteristics, all serving as a latent space for humans to build the dream of a flawless entity. It's a projection surface. 

The non-transactional relationship to this entity is sprituality. The 'someone' to whom people can outsource their doubts, fears, need for cohesion, and agency. The mythology layer becomes a buffer between our messy realities and the ideal we yearn for.

Religion, then, is just a mental model.
