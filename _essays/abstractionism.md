Most people usually don't go deep into a thought. There are many arguments which require an average person to think for days before they can reason their way to the actual truth. This is also why long-term patience is essential in conversation and conflicts. Sometimes you need to let your mind wander and be inspired by unforeseen experiences to better understand that thought.

When someone presents a subset of the truth as the whole, it becomes difficult to argue against because it feels true — yet it's not easy to reason your way back to the parent truth it came from. When you begin to peel back an abstractionist statement with logic, you often find yourself arriving at ideas that bear little relevance to the original statement. This is disingenuousness in disguise.

People often quote other people because they find their words or ideas to be profound, but they can't reason through or defend those ideas — having never walked the path of reasoning that led to them, nor done the work to derive them. This is a subtler form of abstractionism — what we might call borrowed abstractionism.

Some thoughts are densely connected graphs where it's harder — and requires much effort to reason up to the parent node, which is first principle thinking. Other thoughts, while containing identical logical edges and involving different nodes, are more sparsely connected. Fewer pathways lead between ideas. That's why it's often easier to understand a thought by analogy with a less densely connected one.

When you make abstract statements, you accept a risk. If others misinterpret your meaning, you cannot simply blame them for misunderstanding. The responsibility lies with the thinker to provide clarity from the outset. Doing so retroactively is counterintuitive and hence undermines credibility.
