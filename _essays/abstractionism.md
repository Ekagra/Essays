Most people usally don't go deep into a thought. There are many arguments which require an average person to think for a couple of days to see the actual truth by reasoning it from the ground up. This is also why long-term patience is required in conversation and conflicts. Sometimes you need to let your mind wander and get inspired from unforeseen experiences to better understand that thought.

If a person takes a subset of the truth and presents it as the actual truth, then it becomes very hard to reason due to the fact that it feels like truth since it is not easy to reason your way up to the parent node. When you begin to peel off an abstractionist statement with logic, you often find yourself arriving at ideas that have little relevance to the original statement. This is disingenuousness in disguise.
