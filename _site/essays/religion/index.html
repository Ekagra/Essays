  <div class="essay-content">
    <p>Mythology, to me, is a collection of transcendental stories, music, characteristics, all serving as a latent space for humans to build the dream of a flawless entity. The entity is a projection surface.</p>

<p>The non-transactional relationship to this entity is sprituality. It becomes the imagined agent to whom people can outsource their doubts, fears, need for cohesion, and agency.</p>

<p>Religion, then, is just a mental model built using mythology — a way of modeling our place in the world and our relationships within it. It is build with the frameworks described by the mythical entity.</p>

<p>We can use Shiva as an example: he doesn’t offer any explicit moral or ethical frameworks to form a mental model. Hence the non-transactional relationship with him is purely magic of mythology. And that shows how mythology can channel spirituality without necessarily creating a religion.</p>

<p>We see people drawn to spirituality when they are looking for purpose, like need for cohesion or agency in their lives. In such moments, the mythical entity stands ready, offering a relationship where these needs can be outsourced. The path to this relationship is mythology, but the trap is the mythical entity’s religion.</p>

<p>This is why we need to play safe with God.</p>
